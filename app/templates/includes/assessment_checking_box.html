    <h3>Using a Debug Comment Block</h3>
    <p>
      Debug comment blocks help you organize your debugging process and communicate your thought process clearly. Use the following layout in your code:
    </p>
    <pre style="background:#f8f8f8; border-radius:0.4em; padding:1em; font-size:1.08em;">
<span style="color:#d13c3c;"># DEBUG TEST:</span> Describe the test you are running (e.g., input values, expected output)
<span style="color:#d13c3c;"># DEBUG ISSUE:</span> Clearly state the problem or bug you found
<span style="color:#28a745;"># DEBUG FIX:</span> Explain the change you made to fix the issue
    </pre>
    <ul>
      <li><b># DEBUG TEST:</b> What did you test? (e.g., "Tested with input x=5, expected result 25.")</li>
      <li><b># DEBUG ISSUE:</b> What was the problem? (e.g., "Output was 20 instead of 25 due to missing multiplication.")</li>
      <li><b># DEBUG FIX:</b> How did you fix it? (e.g., "Corrected the formula to x*x instead of x+15.")</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This structure makes your debugging process transparent and helps teachers and peers understand your approach.

    <h3>What is Assessment Checking?</h3>
    <p>
      Assessment checking is the process of reviewing student work to ensure it meets the required criteria and learning objectives. It involves:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Verifying code correctness and functionality</li>
      <li>Checking for adherence to style and conventions</li>
      <li>Ensuring documentation and comments are present</li>
      <li>Providing constructive feedback for improvement</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Best Practices for Checking</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a checklist or rubric for consistency</li>
      <li>Test code with a variety of inputs</li>
      <li>Look for edge cases and error handling</li>
      <li>Encourage students to self-check before submission</li>
      <li>Give specific, actionable feedback</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Common Mistakes to Watch For</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Missing or incorrect output</li>
      <li>Poor variable/function naming</li>
      <li>Lack of comments or documentation</li>
      <li>Hardcoded values instead of variables</li>
      <li>Not following assignment instructions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips for Students</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Read the assessment criteria carefully</li>
      <li>Test your code before submitting</li>
      <li>Ask for feedback and revise your work</li>
      <li>Check your comments and documentation</li>
      <li>Reflect on what you learned from the task</li>
    </ul>
