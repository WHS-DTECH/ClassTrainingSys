        <p><b>Merit & Excellence: Where AI Use Must Be Visible and Controlled</b><br>
        For Merit and Excellence, AI use is not the problem — unexamined AI use is. Well-documented AI-assisted coding actually supports Excellence if students can show: they evaluated AI output, they adapted it, they tested and debugged it, they can explain why it works. This is where the separate test & debug table becomes powerful. AI might suggest: “Add this condition” but the student must show: what failed, why the fix was needed, that the fix actually worked.</p>
        <p>Documentation as the “AI Firewall” for AS92004: You can safely say (to students and moderators): AI may help write code, but documentation must be written by the student. Because documentation shows: understanding, reflection, debugging, decision-making. AI-generated code without documentation is weak evidence. AI-assisted code with strong documentation is often stronger than solo coding.</p>
