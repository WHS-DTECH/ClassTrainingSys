    <h1>Coding with AI</h1>
    <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto 2.5em auto;">
        <p>AI tools (like ChatGPT or coding assistants) can be used to help you learn and solve problems, but they do not replace your thinking. For AS92004, your teacher needs to see evidence that you understand your program, not just that it runs. This guide explains how to use AI properly and how to show your own work.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>What You Are Allowed to Use AI For</b><br>
                You may use AI to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Generate starter code</li>
                    <li>Explain syntax you don’t understand</li>
                    <li>Suggest ways to fix errors</li>
                    <li>Help you understand why something isn’t working</li>
                    <li>Give examples of similar problems</li>
                </ul>
                AI is like a helper or tutor, not the person doing the assessment for you.
            </li>
            <li><b>What You Must Still Do Yourself</b><br>
                Even if AI helps you, you must:
                <ul>
                    <li>Decide which code to keep or change</li>
                    <li>Test your program with real inputs</li>
                    <li>Debug problems when things don’t work</li>
                    <li>Write your own comments explaining what the code is doing, why changes were made, how bugs were fixed</li>
                </ul>
                <span style="color:#e67e22;">👉 Your comments and debugging are the evidence that the work is yours.</span>
            </li>
            <li><b>Why Comments Matter When Using AI</b><br>
                AI can write code that looks correct but:
                <ul>
                    <li>May not work in your program</li>
                    <li>May not meet the task requirements</li>
                    <li>May contain errors you don’t notice at first</li>
                </ul>
                When you write comments:
                <ul>
                    <li>You show you understand the code</li>
                    <li>You explain decisions in your own words</li>
                    <li>You prove you tested and fixed problems</li>
                </ul>
                A working program with no comments is weak evidence. A working program with clear comments is strong evidence.
