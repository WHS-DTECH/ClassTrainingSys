| 3-5 | Emerging | Minimal evidence; significant gaps; limited attempts |
| 8-10 | Developing | Some competency shown; basic understanding; some implementation |
| 12-15 | Proficient | Good evidence; clear understanding; mostly correct implementation |
| 16-20 | Advanced | Strong evidence; sophisticated understanding; well-executed |
| 25+ | Exemplary | Excellent evidence; mastery; exceeds expectations; innovative |

**Grading Model:** Partial credit encourages growth; clear progression toward mastery
